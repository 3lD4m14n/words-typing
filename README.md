# Game Rules
The game is about correctly writing as many words as possible within a set time. The game has three different durations, and the longer the duration, the higher the bonus points the player will receive for not making mistakes.

The game rewards the user for making the least amount of errors possible. The more you write without making mistakes, the more points you will earn, especially with a longer selected time.

points formula: `WordLength * (10 * duration - errors)`
